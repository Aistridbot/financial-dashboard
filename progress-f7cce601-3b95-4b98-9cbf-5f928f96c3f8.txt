Task: FULL FINANCIAL MVP: canonical repo baseline; this session implements US-001 schema + migration + seed foundation.
Started: 2026-03-01 17:52 CET

## Codebase Patterns
- Database persistence uses Node built-in `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`) with synchronous migration/seed scripts to keep setup dependency-light.
- Migration baseline is tracked in a `schema_migrations` table with monotonic integer versions.
- DB location is resolved by `FINANCIAL_DB_PATH` override (for tests) and defaults to `.data/financial.db` for local runs.
- Test isolation uses temp SQLite file paths per test case and verifies schema contracts via SQLite PRAGMA introspection.
- Tests use Node's built-in test runner (`node --test`) and repository scripts should remain minimal/commonjs-compatible.

## 2026-03-01 17:58 CET - US-001: Establish persistent financial schema and migration baseline
- Added DB infrastructure under `src/db/`:
  - `connection.js`: DB path resolution + foreign key enablement.
  - `migrate.js`: migration framework and baseline migration (version 1).
  - `seed.js`: deterministic fixture seed for demo portfolio data.
- Implemented migration SQL creating `portfolios`, `holdings`, and `transactions` with explicit PK/FK/not-null/check constraints.
- Added required lookup indexes:
  - `idx_holdings_portfolio_id`
  - `idx_transactions_portfolio_id`
  - `idx_transactions_holding_id`
- Added deterministic seed fixture (`portfolio-demo-001`, `holding-aapl-001`, and two transactions) for test usage.
- Added npm scripts:
  - `npm run migrate`
  - `npm run seed`
- Added `src/db/migrateAndSeed.test.js` to validate:
  - migration creates tables/FKs/indexes and schema version 1
  - seed inserts deterministic records and expected counts
- Ran validation commands successfully: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm test`.
- **Learnings:** Using explicit DB path override keeps tests hermetic and avoids coupling to workspace-local DB files.
