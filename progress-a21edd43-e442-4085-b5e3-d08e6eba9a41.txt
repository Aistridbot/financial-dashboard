## Codebase Patterns
- Data repositories live in `src/data/` and expose a default db path constant plus `load*` and `assertValid*` functions.
- Deterministic validation errors are asserted in Jest tests using exact `.toThrow(...)` message matches.
- Seed data is stored in `db/*.json` and treated as repository-backed source-of-truth fixtures.

## 2026-03-01 07:48 CET - US-001: Add canonical smoke story seed data with unique ordered IDs
- Implemented canonical smoke story seed file at `db/smoke-stories.json` with exactly 3 stories, unique IDs, and explicit `sequence` values 1..3.
- Added new repository module `src/data/smokeStoryRepository.js` to load and validate smoke stories.
- Added validation rules for duplicate story IDs, missing/non-integer sequence, and non-sequential ordering.
- Added `tests/smokeStoryRepository.test.js` covering success path, duplicate IDs, non-sequential sequence, and missing sequence validation.
- Ran `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` successfully.
- **Learnings:** Existing project convention is deterministic, human-readable error strings from validators that are asserted directly in tests.
