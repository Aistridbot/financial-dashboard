Task: RESUME BASELINE: PR262 + planner/setup contract guard. Canonical repo /Users/aistridbot/.openclaw/workspace/financial-dashboard, max 3 stories, proceed full pipeline.

## Codebase Patterns
- Data repositories live in `src/data/` and expose a default db path constant plus `load*` and `assertValid*` functions.
- Deterministic validation errors are asserted in Jest tests using exact `.toThrow(...)` message matches.
- Contract fixtures are version-controlled under `db/*.json`, and validators enforce exact value/order for contract arrays to prevent drift.
- Contract guard validators should load the baseline fixture from `pr262BaselineContractRepository` so canonical repo, required keys, and max story limits stay centralized.

## 2026-03-01 14:00 CET - US-001: Add PR262 baseline contract fixture for planner/setup outputs
- Added canonical baseline fixture `db/pr262-baseline-contract.json` with fixed `canonicalRepo`, `maxStories: 3`, and explicit planner/setup required keys.
- Implemented `src/data/pr262BaselineContractRepository.js` with strict validation and deterministic error messages for object shape, canonical path, max stories value, and exact required key arrays.
- Added repository tests in `tests/pr262BaselineContractRepository.test.js` for success path and contract-drift failures (`canonicalRepo`, planner keys, setup keys).
- Ran `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` successfully.
- **Learnings:** For pipeline contracts, validating exact key order/content in fixtures gives deterministic contract-guard behavior and clear failure diagnostics.

## 2026-03-01 14:08 CET - US-002: Implement backend contract guard validator for planner/setup payloads
- Added `src/data/contractGuardValidator.js` with `assertValidPlannerPayload` and `assertValidSetupPayload`.
- Validator now loads the PR262 baseline contract fixture and enforces planner/setup required keys, canonical `REPO`, `STORIES_JSON` array type, max stories (`3`), and deterministic duplicate story id detection.
- Added deterministic planner/setup missing-key and guardrail error messages aligned with existing repository tests.
- Added tests in `tests/contractGuardValidator.test.js` covering valid payloads and failure paths for max stories, duplicate ids, canonical repo mismatch, and missing setup keys.
- Ran `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` successfully.
- **Learnings:** Keeping payload validation contract-driven (instead of hardcoded per validator) prevents drift and keeps planner/setup guardrails synchronized.
